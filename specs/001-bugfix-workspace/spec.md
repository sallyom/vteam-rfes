# Feature Specification: BugFix Workspace Type

**Feature Branch**: `001-bugfix-workspace`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "We need a new Workspace type for a Bug Fix. It should create or review or utilize a bug.md and/or a bugfix.md that gets pushed to the GH Spec Repo, similar to rfe.md for Ideate phase of RFE Workspace. This BugFix workspace won't use the spec-kit /slash commands. It will use claude runner with agents to research and examine the bug from the human's bug report and/or a bug.md file in the spec repo. If bug.md is found, use it. If not, take the human's bug description and create a bug.md from that. Then, create a bugfix.md as the result of the session. Look for both a bug.md and bugfix.md. A bug-review session will look for a bug.md and/or generate one from human interaction. A bug-fix session will create a bugfix.md that outlines the tasks/steps taken to implement the fix. The fix will be made in the supporting repos. The Spec.md will describe the bug and the fix. It will be used by release engineers to generate a changelog"

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## Overview

The BugFix Workspace Type provides developers with a structured workflow for bug identification, resolution planning, and implementation tracking. Developers can initiate bug work from either a text description or an existing GitHub Issue URL. The workspace guides them through three specialized sessions (Bug-review, Bug-resolution-plan, Bug-implement-fix) plus a generic session for ad-hoc work. All bug work is tracked in GitHub Issues (primary artifact) with optional manual synchronization to Jira Tasks for project management visibility. Implementation documentation is organized in bug-specific folders within a centralized Spec Repository, serving both release engineering needs and as a personal portfolio of bug fixes.

**Why This Feature Matters:**
- Eliminates context-switching between GitHub Issues, Jira, and development environments
- Reduces manual tracking overhead through one-click Jira synchronization
- Provides standardized bug documentation for release engineering and changelog generation
- Creates organized portfolio of all bug fixes in developer's Spec Repository
- Ensures project managers have visibility into bug status without automatic sync complexity

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Main Success Scenario: Fix a Bug from GitHub Issue with Jira Sync**

A developer receives a bug notification via GitHub Issue #1234. They create a new BugFix Workspace by providing the GitHub Issue URL. The workspace validates the issue exists and creates a folder `bug-1234/` in their Spec Repository.

The developer initiates a **Bug-review session** where the system analyzes the bug, researches the codebase, identifies root causes, and updates GitHub Issue #1234 with technical analysis findings. The developer clicks a "Sync to Jira" button, which creates a Jira Task (e.g., PROJ-5678) containing the GitHub Issue's key details and establishes bidirectional links between the GitHub Issue and Jira Task.

Next, the developer starts a **Bug-resolution-plan session** where the system proposes resolution strategies. The workspace creates `bug-1234/bugfix-gh-1234.md` in the Spec Repository containing the GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL, and implementation plan. GitHub Issue #1234 is updated with the resolution approach.

The developer then initiates a **Bug-implement-fix session** where the system implements the fix in a feature branch `bugfix/gh-1234` in the supporting repository, writes tests, and updates documentation. The `bugfix-gh-1234.md` file is updated with detailed implementation steps. GitHub Issue #1234 receives an update linking to the feature branch. The developer clicks "Sync to Jira" again, and the workspace posts the bugfix.md content as a comment to Jira Task PROJ-5678.

Finally, the developer validates the fix manually, creates a pull request, and adds the PR link to both GitHub Issue #1234 and `bugfix-gh-1234.md`. The `bug-1234/` folder now contains a complete record of the bug fix for release engineering and portfolio purposes.

**Alternative Flow 1: Bug from Text Description**

A developer encounters a bug during development and creates a BugFix Workspace by providing a text description including symptoms, reproduction steps, and expected vs actual behavior. The workspace automatically creates GitHub Issue #5678 with a standardized template populated from the description, notifies the developer, creates folder `bug-5678/` in the Spec Repository, and the workflow continues as described above.

**Alternative Flow 2: Skip Jira Sync**

A developer follows the main workflow but chooses not to use the "Sync to Jira" buttons. The workflow completes successfully with GitHub Issue as the sole tracking artifact. The `bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` is created without a Jira Task URL. This supports teams or projects not using Jira.

**Alternative Flow 3: Generic Session for Ad-Hoc Work**

A developer in an existing BugFix Workspace needs to perform ad-hoc investigation or exploration. They initiate a generic session for open-ended work, then return to structured sessions when ready.

### Acceptance Scenarios

**Scenario 1: Create BugFix Workspace from GitHub Issue**
- **Given** a developer has a valid GitHub Issue URL (e.g., `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/1234`)
- **When** they create a BugFix Workspace by providing the GitHub Issue URL
- **Then** the workspace validates the issue exists, loads its details, and creates folder `bug-1234/` in the Spec Repository

**Scenario 2: Create BugFix Workspace from Text Description**
- **Given** a developer has a bug description including symptoms, reproduction steps, and expected behavior
- **When** they create a BugFix Workspace by providing the text description
- **Then** the workspace automatically creates a GitHub Issue with standardized format, notifies the developer of the issue number, and creates folder `bug-<issue-number>/` in the Spec Repository

**Scenario 3: Bug-review Session Analyzes Bug**
- **Given** a BugFix Workspace exists for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer initiates a Bug-review session
- **Then** the workspace analyzes the bug, researches the codebase for root causes, and updates GitHub Issue #1234 with technical analysis findings as a comment

**Scenario 4: Sync to Jira from Bug-review Session**
- **Given** a Bug-review session has completed analysis for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer clicks the "Sync to Jira" button
- **Then** the workspace creates a Jira Task (e.g., PROJ-5678) with GitHub Issue title, description, and status, adds a link to GitHub Issue #1234 in the Jira Task, and updates GitHub Issue #1234 with a link to Jira Task PROJ-5678

**Scenario 5: Bug-resolution-plan Session Creates Implementation Plan**
- **Given** a BugFix Workspace exists for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer initiates a Bug-resolution-plan session
- **Then** the workspace proposes resolution strategies, creates `bug-1234/bugfix-gh-1234.md` in Spec Repository with GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL (if synced), and implementation plan, and updates GitHub Issue #1234 with the resolution approach

**Scenario 6: Bug-implement-fix Session Implements Fix**
- **Given** a Bug-resolution-plan session has created an implementation plan for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer initiates a Bug-implement-fix session
- **Then** the workspace implements the fix in feature branch `bugfix/gh-1234` in the supporting repository, writes/updates tests, updates documentation, updates `bugfix-gh-1234.md` with implementation steps, and updates GitHub Issue #1234 with a link to the feature branch

**Scenario 7: Sync bugfix.md to Jira from Bug-implement-fix Session**
- **Given** a Bug-implement-fix session has completed implementation for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer clicks the "Sync to Jira" button
- **Then** the workspace posts the contents of `bugfix-gh-1234.md` as a comment to the existing Jira Task PROJ-5678

**Scenario 8: Subsequent Jira Syncs Update Existing Task**
- **Given** a Jira Task PROJ-5678 was previously created for GitHub Issue #1234
- **When** the developer clicks "Sync to Jira" again from any session
- **Then** the workspace updates the existing Jira Task PROJ-5678 rather than creating a new Jira Task

**Scenario 9: Generic Session for Ad-Hoc Work**
- **Given** a BugFix Workspace exists for a bug
- **When** the developer initiates a generic session
- **Then** the workspace provides open-ended access to analysis and implementation tools without structured session constraints

**Scenario 10: Developer Portfolio and Release Engineering Access**
- **Given** multiple BugFix Workspaces have been completed
- **When** a developer or release engineer accesses the Spec Repository
- **Then** they can view organized bug folders (`bug-<issue-number>/`) containing `bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` files with GitHub Issue URLs, Jira Task URLs (if synced), implementation plans, steps taken, and PR links

### Edge Cases

**What happens when a provided GitHub Issue URL is invalid or inaccessible?**
- The workspace validates the GitHub Issue exists before proceeding. If invalid or inaccessible, the workspace notifies the developer with a clear error message and prompts them to provide a valid URL or switch to text description mode.

**What happens when a developer tries to create a BugFix Workspace for an issue that already has an existing workspace?**
- The workspace checks for existing `bug-<issue-number>/` folders. If found, the workspace notifies the developer and offers to resume the existing workspace rather than creating a duplicate.

**What happens if the "Sync to Jira" button is clicked but Jira authentication fails?**
- The workspace displays an error message indicating authentication failure and provides guidance on configuring Jira credentials. The session continues normally, allowing the developer to retry sync later or skip Jira integration.

**What happens if a developer wants to work on multiple bugs simultaneously?**
- Each BugFix Workspace is independent and isolated by bug number. Developers can create and work in multiple BugFix Workspaces concurrently, with each maintaining its own folder and documentation in the Spec Repository.

**What happens when a developer provides a text description but the system cannot determine sufficient information to create a meaningful GitHub Issue?**
- The workspace prompts the developer for additional details (symptoms, reproduction steps, expected behavior) until enough information is gathered to populate the standardized GitHub Issue template.

**What happens if the supporting repository already has a branch named `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>`?**
- The workspace checks for existing branches. If the branch exists, the workspace notifies the developer and offers options: resume work on existing branch, create a variant branch name (e.g., `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>-v2`), or abort and have developer manually resolve the conflict.

**What happens when GitHub Issue is updated externally (by another developer or PM) during an active BugFix Workspace session?**
- The workspace operates on the initial state of the GitHub Issue but allows developers to manually refresh or review external updates. Session updates add new comments to GitHub Issue without overwriting external changes.

**What happens if a developer wants to add additional artifacts (screenshots, logs, test results) to the bug folder?**
- The `bug-<issue-number>/` folder in the Spec Repository is a standard directory. Developers can manually add any additional files to this folder, and `bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` can reference them.
