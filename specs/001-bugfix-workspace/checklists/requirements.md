# Specification Quality Checklist: BugFix Workspace Type

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASS
All content is focused on user needs and business value without implementation details. The specification is written for business stakeholders with clear explanations of what the feature does and why it matters.

### Requirement Completeness - PASS
All requirements are testable and unambiguous:
- 40 functional requirements (FR-001 through FR-040) with specific, verifiable criteria
- 12 success criteria (SC-001 through SC-012) that are measurable and technology-agnostic
- 6 non-functional requirements (NFR-001 through NFR-006) addressing security, reliability, and usability
- 10 acceptance scenarios covering main flows and edge cases
- 8 detailed edge cases with clear expected behaviors
- Comprehensive assumptions and dependencies documented
- Scope boundaries clearly defined (in-scope and out-of-scope items listed)

### Feature Readiness - PASS
The specification is complete and ready for planning:
- User scenarios describe end-to-end workflows from developer perspective
- Success criteria focus on outcomes (time to complete tasks, reduction in manual overhead, developer satisfaction) rather than implementation
- All functional requirements map to acceptance scenarios
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers - all decisions made with reasonable defaults documented in assumptions

## Notes

The specification successfully balances detail with abstraction. Key strengths:
1. Clear separation between three session types (Bug-review, Bug-resolution-plan, Bug-implement-fix) plus generic session
2. Well-defined two entry points (GitHub Issue URL or text description)
3. Optional Jira integration design allows flexibility for teams not using Jira
4. Comprehensive edge case coverage anticipates common failure modes
5. Success criteria are specific and measurable (e.g., "under 30 seconds", "within 5 minutes", "80% reduction")
6. Technology-agnostic success criteria focus on user experience rather than implementation

All checklist items pass. The specification is ready for `/speckit.plan` or direct implementation planning.
