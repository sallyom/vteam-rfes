# Feature Specification: Llamaindex RAG Demo with Ramalama

**Feature Branch**: `001-llamaindex-ramalama-demo`
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Status**: Draft
**Input**: User description: "Create a docs2db demo using Llamaindex and ramalama. It should be similar to the current llamastack demo that demonstrates how to create a Llamastack with PGVectorDB and a docs2db-generated vector database."

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### User Story 1 - Deploy Containerized RAG System (Priority: P1)

Developers want to quickly deploy a complete RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) system using Llamaindex and Ramalama with a pre-populated docs2db vector database, using containerized infrastructure for easy setup and portability.

**Why this priority**: This is the core functionality - providing a working, deployable RAG system. Without this, there's no demo to show. This represents the minimum viable product that demonstrates the integration.

**Independent Test**: Can be fully tested by running the deployment commands and verifying all containers start successfully, services are accessible, and the system is ready for queries. Delivers a complete working RAG environment.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** a docs2db-generated database dump file exists, **When** the developer builds the container images, **Then** all images build successfully without errors
2. **Given** the container images are built, **When** the developer deploys the pod configuration, **Then** all containers start and reach a healthy state within 5 minutes
3. **Given** the pod is running, **When** the developer checks service endpoints, **Then** the Ramalama model server, vector database, and Llamaindex service are all accessible
4. **Given** the system is deployed, **When** the developer views the documentation, **Then** clear instructions exist for building, deploying, and verifying the system

---

### User Story 2 - Execute RAG Queries (Priority: P2)

Developers and users want to execute natural language queries against the deployed RAG system to retrieve relevant information from the ingested documentation.

**Why this priority**: After deployment (P1), the ability to actually use the RAG system for queries is the next critical feature. This demonstrates the system works end-to-end.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested independently by using the client scripts or API endpoints to submit queries and verify relevant results are returned. Demonstrates value even without UI.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the RAG system is running, **When** a user submits a query via the client script, **Then** relevant document chunks are returned with similarity scores
2. **Given** a query is submitted, **When** results are returned, **Then** each result includes the source document reference, text snippet, and relevance score
3. **Given** multiple queries on different topics, **When** each query is processed, **Then** results are contextually relevant to the specific query topic
4. **Given** the RAG system is under load, **When** multiple concurrent queries are submitted, **Then** all queries return results within acceptable response time

---

### User Story 3 - Access Interactive Web Interface (Priority: P3)

Users want to interact with the RAG system through a web-based interface for easier exploration and demonstration purposes.

**Why this priority**: While useful for demos and exploration, the web UI is not essential for the core functionality. The system works via API/client scripts, making this an enhancement.

**Independent Test**: Can be tested by accessing the web UI, submitting queries through the interface, and verifying results display correctly. Adds user experience value on top of the working API.

**Acceptance Scenarios**:

1. **Given** the system is deployed, **When** a user navigates to the web interface URL, **Then** the interface loads and is ready to accept queries
2. **Given** the web interface is open, **When** a user types a query and submits it, **Then** results are displayed in a readable format with source attribution
3. **Given** query results are displayed, **When** a user views the interface, **Then** document metadata and relevance scores are clearly shown

### Edge Cases

- What happens when the database dump file is missing or corrupted during container build?
- How does the system handle queries when the model server is not yet fully initialized?
- What happens when the vector database runs out of storage space?
- How does the system respond when submitted queries exceed token limits?
- What happens when network connectivity between containers is interrupted?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

- **FR-001**: System MUST provide a containerized deployment using Podman or Docker with all required services (Ramalama model server, PGVector database, Llamaindex service)
- **FR-002**: System MUST initialize the vector database with a docs2db-generated database dump during container setup
- **FR-003**: System MUST support querying the vector database using natural language through Llamaindex
- **FR-004**: System MUST use Ramalama as the model serving infrastructure for embeddings and inference
- **FR-005**: System MUST return query results with document chunks, similarity scores, and source attribution
- **FR-006**: System MUST provide client scripts or examples for programmatic interaction with the RAG system
- **FR-007**: System MUST include documentation with step-by-step instructions for building containers, deploying services, executing test queries, and resolving common errors
- **FR-008**: System MUST provide a web-based interface for interactive query submission and result viewing
- **FR-009**: System MUST support persistent storage for the vector database across container restarts
- **FR-010**: System MUST expose health check endpoints for monitoring service status
- **FR-011**: System MUST log errors and operational events for troubleshooting
- **FR-012**: System MUST handle graceful startup when dependent services initialize at different rates

### Key Entities

- **RAG Query**: User's natural language question, query embedding vector, similarity threshold, result limit
- **Query Result**: Retrieved document chunk, similarity score, source document reference, chunk metadata
- **Vector Database**: Collection of document embeddings, document metadata, chunk associations
- **Model Server**: Embedding model configuration, inference model, model artifacts, health status
- **Container Configuration**: Service definitions, network configuration, volume mappings, environment variables

## Success Criteria *(mandatory)*

### Measurable Outcomes

- **SC-001**: Developers can deploy the complete RAG system from start to finish in under 15 minutes (excluding model download time)
- **SC-002**: System responds to queries with relevant results in under 5 seconds for typical documentation queries
- **SC-003**: System handles at least 10 concurrent queries without performance degradation
- **SC-004**: 80% of developers unfamiliar with the system can successfully deploy and execute their first query within 30 minutes following the documentation
- **SC-005**: System maintains 99% uptime during normal operation once fully initialized
- **SC-006**: Query results include source attribution for 100% of returned document chunks
- **SC-007**: Demo can be deployed on at least 2 different container platforms without modification
