# Specification Quality Checklist: Llamaindex RAG Demo with Ramalama

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-31
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs) - **EXCEPTION**: This is a demo/integration feature where specific technologies (Llamaindex, Ramalama) are part of the requirements
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs - Demonstrates RAG system deployment and usage value
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders - **ADJUSTED**: Target audience is developers, appropriate technical level maintained
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous - FR-007 improved for specificity
- [x] Success criteria are measurable - SC-004 improved with specific percentage and time
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details) - **EXCEPTION**: Demo features inherently showcase specific technologies
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded - Added explicit In Scope / Out of Scope sections
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified - Added comprehensive Assumptions and Dependencies sections

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria - Covered through user story acceptance scenarios
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows - P1: Deploy, P2: Query, P3: Web UI
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification - **EXCEPTION**: Acceptable for demo/integration features

## Notes

**Special Considerations for Demo Features:**
This is a demonstration/integration feature where the goal is explicitly to showcase specific technologies working together (Llamaindex + Ramalama + docs2db). Unlike production features, the technologies themselves are part of the requirements, not implementation details. The spec appropriately:
- Names the technologies being integrated (Llamaindex, Ramalama, PGVector)
- Focuses on deployment simplicity and developer experience
- Provides clear scope boundaries
- Documents assumptions about user skill level and environment

**Validation Status:** âœ… PASSED
All checklist items pass. The spec is ready for `/speckit.plan` or `/speckit.clarify` if needed.
