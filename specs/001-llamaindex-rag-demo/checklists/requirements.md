# Specification Quality Checklist: LlamaIndex + pgvectordb RAG Demo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-21
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

### Validation Results - Pass

**Content Quality**: All items pass
- Specification avoids implementation details like specific Python libraries, container technologies, or code structure
- Focus is on user workflows, outcomes, and capabilities
- Written in accessible language describing what users need, not how it's built
- All mandatory sections (User Scenarios, Requirements, Success Criteria) are complete

**Requirement Completeness**: All items pass
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present - all requirements are concrete and actionable
- Requirements are testable (e.g., "Demo MUST provide containerized deployment" can be verified by attempting deployment)
- Success criteria use measurable metrics (time limits, memory thresholds, success rates)
- Success criteria describe user-facing outcomes ("Users can complete workflow in under 15 minutes") rather than technical metrics
- Acceptance scenarios use Given-When-Then format with clear conditions
- Edge cases section identifies 8 failure scenarios users might encounter
- Scope is bounded by the 20 functional requirements which define what's included
- Dependencies implicit in the requirements (docs2db tool, pgvector, sample documents)

**Feature Readiness**: All items pass
- Each functional requirement maps to testable acceptance scenarios in user stories
- User scenarios (P1-P3) cover the primary user journey from setup through customization
- Success criteria provide clear targets that can be measured (query latency, memory usage, completion time)
- No leakage of implementation details - spec doesn't mention Python, Docker, LlamaIndex library specifics

**Assumptions Made**:
- Default embedding model is all-MiniLM-L6-v2 (industry-standard choice for RAG demos)
- Default LLM provider is Ollama (local, cost-free option suitable for demos)
- Minimum resource requirement is 8GB RAM (reasonable for development laptops)
- Sample document set should be small (<100MB) for quick demo experience
- Single-instance deployment is sufficient for demo purposes
- Database schema from docs2db is compatible with LlamaIndex's expectations (or adapter layer will be built)

**Ready for Next Phase**: âœ… Specification is complete and ready for `/speckit.plan`
