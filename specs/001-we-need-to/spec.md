## User Scenarios & Testing

### Primary User Story

As a **system administrator managing edge infrastructure**, I want to deploy and update Podman containers using declarative Quadlet files tracked in git, so that I can leverage modern Podman tooling for systemd integration while ensuring my FetchIt deployment uses secure, up-to-date dependencies.

**Why this matters:**
- Current FetchIt dependencies (Go 1.17, older Podman libraries) contain security vulnerabilities and lack modern features
- Podman has deprecated `podman generate systemd` in favor of Quadlets (introduced in 4.4+)
- Managing systemd units manually is complex and error-prone
- GitOps workflows require reliable, declarative configuration approaches

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Dependency Update Success**
   - **Given** FetchIt is currently using Go 1.17 and Podman v4 libraries with known CVEs
   - **When** dependencies are updated to Go 1.21+ and Podman v4.9+/v5.x
   - **Then** all existing methods (Raw, Systemd, Kube, Ansible, FileTransfer) continue to function without regression
   - **And** no high or critical severity CVEs remain in the dependency tree
   - **And** FetchIt builds successfully on AMD64 and ARM64 architectures

2. **Quadlet Deployment for Root User**
   - **Given** a git repository containing webapp.container, webapp.volume, and webapp.network Quadlet files
   - **When** user configures FetchIt with a Quadlet target pointing to this repository with `root: true`
   - **Then** FetchIt deploys the Quadlet files to `/etc/containers/systemd/`
   - **And** systemd daemon reloads to register the new units
   - **And** the container starts as a systemd service
   - **And** the container persists across system reboots

3. **Quadlet Deployment for Non-Root User**
   - **Given** a git repository containing Quadlet files for a user application
   - **When** user configures FetchIt with a Quadlet target with `root: false`
   - **Then** FetchIt deploys the Quadlet files to `~/.config/containers/systemd/`
   - **And** services run in the user systemd context
   - **And** user can manage services with `systemctl --user` commands

4. **Automatic Updates on Git Changes**
   - **Given** a container is running via Quadlet method managed by FetchIt
   - **When** the user updates the .container file in the git repository (e.g., changes image tag)
   - **Then** FetchIt detects the change on the next scheduled check
   - **And** FetchIt updates the systemd Quadlet file
   - **And** systemd restarts the container with the new configuration
   - **And** the container runs successfully with updated settings

5. **Multi-Container Application with Dependencies**
   - **Given** an application requiring a database container, web container, shared volume, and custom network
   - **When** user commits myapp.volume, myapp-db.container, myapp-web.container, and myapp.network files to git
   - **Then** FetchIt deploys all Quadlet files to the systemd directory
   - **And** systemd starts services in the correct dependency order
   - **And** containers can communicate over the custom network
   - **And** data persists in the shared volume

6. **Scheduled Quadlet Synchronization**
   - **Given** a Quadlet target configured with schedule `*/5 * * * *` (every 5 minutes)
   - **When** the schedule triggers
   - **Then** FetchIt pulls the latest changes from the git repository
   - **And** FetchIt processes any new or modified Quadlet files
   - **And** FetchIt applies changes to systemd
   - **And** affected services restart if needed

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when a Quadlet file references a non-existent volume or network?**
  - FetchIt should create those, but with very clear logs. 

- **How does the system handle malformed Quadlet files?**
  - System must detect syntax errors and report them clearly to the user without disrupting other running containers

- **What happens when multiple Quadlet files change simultaneously in a single git commit?**
  - System must process all changes atomically and handle systemd reloads efficiently to avoid race conditions

- **How does the system handle Quadlet deployment when systemd is not available?**
  - System must detect the absence of systemd and fail gracefully with an informative error message

- **What happens when a dependency update introduces breaking API changes?**
  - Existing functionality must continue to work, or upgrade path documentation must be provided

- **How are Quadlet file naming conflicts handled?**
  - System must detect conflicts (e.g., two repos deploying the same .container filename) and report the issue clearly

## Requirements

### Functional Requirements

**Dependency Updates:**

- **FR-001**: System MUST update Go version to 1.21 or later to benefit from security patches, performance improvements, and modern language features

### Key Entities

- **Quadlet File**: A declarative systemd unit file with Podman-specific syntax (extensions: .container, .volume, .network, .kube, .pod, .build, .image) that describes container lifecycle, networking, storage, or related resources. These files are the primary configuration artifact for the Quadlet method.

- **TargetConfig (Quadlet Type)**: Configuration structure in config.yaml that defines how FetchIt should handle a Quadlet-based git repository. Includes attributes such as:
  - `name`: Identifier for the target
  - `url`: Git repository URL
  - `branch`: Git branch to track
  - `targetPath`: Directory within the repository containing Quadlet files
  - `root`: Boolean flag indicating whether to deploy as root (system-wide) or user-level
  - `schedule`: Cron expression for periodic synchronization
  - `glob`: Pattern for filtering specific Quadlet files

- **Systemd Unit**: The runtime representation of a deployed Quadlet file, managed by systemd. FetchIt interacts with systemd to reload daemon configuration and manage service lifecycle.

- **Dependency Manifest**: The `go.mod` file that declares all direct and transitive dependencies with version constraints. Must be updated to reflect modern library versions while maintaining compatibility.
