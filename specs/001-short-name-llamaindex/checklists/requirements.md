# Specification Quality Checklist: Llamaindex + RamaLama RAG Demo

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2025-10-30
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Validation Results

### Content Quality - PASSED
All items passed:
- Specification focuses on user needs (ML engineers, data scientists, solution architects)
- Business value clearly articulated (rapid prototyping, reduced complexity, customer engagement)
- No implementation-specific details (frameworks, languages, code structure)
- Written for business stakeholders with clear success criteria

### Requirement Completeness - PASSED
All items passed:
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers present in the specification
- All 37 functional requirements are testable (e.g., FR-002: "System MUST reach operational state within 2 minutes")
- Success criteria are measurable (e.g., "deployment in under 30 minutes", ">70% similarity scores")
- Success criteria avoid implementation details (focus on user outcomes like deployment speed, query accuracy)
- 7 acceptance scenarios defined with clear Given-When-Then format
- 7 edge cases identified with expected behaviors
- Scope clearly bounded with In Scope and Out of Scope sections
- Dependencies and assumptions explicitly documented

### Feature Readiness - PASSED
All items passed:
- Each functional requirement maps to acceptance criteria or edge cases
- Primary user story provides complete journey for ML engineer persona
- Alternative flows cover API-only usage, customer demos, and configuration
- Success criteria align with user outcomes (deployment speed, query accuracy, resource efficiency)
- Specification maintains technology-agnostic approach throughout

## Overall Assessment

**Status**: âœ… SPECIFICATION READY FOR PLANNING

The specification is complete, comprehensive, and ready for the next phase (`/speckit.plan`). All quality criteria have been met:

- Clear business value and user focus
- Comprehensive functional and non-functional requirements
- Well-defined user scenarios and acceptance criteria
- Measurable, technology-agnostic success criteria
- Clearly bounded scope with documented dependencies and assumptions
- No ambiguities requiring clarification

## Notes

- The specification was derived from a comprehensive RFE document, which provided detailed requirements and use cases
- No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers were needed due to the completeness of the source RFE
- The spec successfully abstracts implementation details (Llamaindex, RamaLama, Podman) from the RFE while maintaining clear user-focused requirements
- Success criteria focus on user-observable outcomes rather than technical implementation metrics

## Next Steps

Proceed to `/speckit.plan` to create the implementation plan based on this specification.
