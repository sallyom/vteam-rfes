## Overview

A containerized demonstration that enables ML engineers, data scientists, and solution architects to experience production-like RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) workflows by converting their document collections into intelligent, queryable knowledge bases. The demo provides a reference architecture for deploying RAG systems in local development environments with a clear path to production deployment.

### Business Value

**Current Pain Points:**
- ML engineers spend days manually integrating RAG components (vector databases, embedding models, LLM serving)
- Teams lack reference implementations for containerized RAG deployments
- Solution architects cannot easily demonstrate RAG capabilities with customer documents
- No standardized pattern exists for local-to-production RAG workflows

**Value Delivered:**
- **Rapid prototyping**: Working RAG system deployed in under 30 minutes
- **Reduced integration complexity**: Pre-configured, tested components
- **Customer engagement**: Runnable demos with customer's own documents
- **Learning resource**: Production-quality reference architecture

### Success Criteria

Success is measured by these user-focused outcomes:

1. **Deployment Speed**: Users can deploy a working RAG system in under 30 minutes from receiving document collection
2. **Query Accuracy**: System returns relevant results with >70% similarity scores for queries about indexed content
3. **Startup Reliability**: All system components reach operational state within 2 minutes of deployment initiation
4. **Documentation Completeness**: New users (unfamiliar with the system) successfully complete setup on first attempt without external assistance
5. **Resource Efficiency**: System operates within 4GB RAM and 20GB storage on standard development workstations
6. **Model Compatibility**: System detects and prevents mismatched embedding models, failing safely with actionable error messages
7. **Result Relevance**: Queries return answers citing correct source documents from the indexed collection
8. **Health Visibility**: System health status is queryable and reports component readiness accurately

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

**Actor**: ML Engineer evaluating RAG capabilities for enterprise knowledge base

**Goal**: Validate that RAG technology can effectively answer questions about their organization's technical documentation

**Journey**:
1. ML engineer receives request to evaluate RAG for 500-document internal knowledge base
2. Engineer prepares sample document collection (30 mixed-format files: PDFs, HTML, Markdown)
3. Engineer processes documents through document-to-database pipeline (5 minutes)
4. Engineer deploys demo system with processed database (5 minutes, includes model download)
5. Engineer queries system with 10 representative questions
6. System returns relevant answers with source citations in 2-3 seconds per query
7. Engineer reviews architecture to understand deployment patterns
8. Engineer reports positive findings, recommends production evaluation

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a collection of 30 technical documents in mixed formats (PDF, HTML, Markdown), **When** user processes them and deploys the demo, **Then** system successfully starts and allows querying the document content

2. **Given** the demo is deployed and operational, **When** user submits query "What are the system requirements?", **Then** system returns answer generated from relevant document sections with similarity scores >0.7 and cites source documents

3. **Given** the demo is running, **When** user requests health status, **Then** system reports connection status for all components (database: connected, model: loaded, embeddings: ready)

4. **Given** user has processed documents with embedding model A, **When** user attempts to deploy with mismatched embedding model B, **Then** system fails startup with clear error explaining the mismatch and required correction

5. **Given** user follows quick-start documentation, **When** user completes setup for the first time, **Then** deployment succeeds in under 30 minutes including model download time

6. **Given** the demo is deployed, **When** user queries about content not present in indexed documents, **Then** system returns response indicating no relevant information found, rather than hallucinating answers

7. **Given** user stops and restarts the demo, **When** system restarts, **Then** database reloads successfully and system returns to operational state within 2 minutes

### Edge Cases

- **What happens when the document database is empty?** System starts successfully but queries return "no indexed documents found" messages rather than errors
- **What happens when multiple users query simultaneously?** System queues requests and processes them sequentially (concurrent handling not required for demo)
- **What happens when the model serving component fails to start?** Health check reports unhealthy status, queries fail with "model unavailable" errors, system logs indicate model loading issues
- **What happens when network connectivity is lost during model download?** Initial deployment fails with clear error; user must retry after connectivity restoration
- **What happens when user provides documents in unsupported formats?** Document processing pipeline (outside demo scope) reports format errors; demo operates only on successfully processed documents
- **What happens when user exceeds resource limits (>4GB RAM)?** System may fail to start or experience degraded performance; documentation warns about minimum requirements
- **What happens when embedding dimensions don't match between model and database?** System detects dimension mismatch during startup validation and fails with specific error indicating expected vs. actual dimensions

### Alternative Flows

**Alternative Flow 1: API-Only Usage**
- User deploys demo without optional UI component
- User queries system programmatically via HTTP API
- User integrates API into existing workflow or application
- Use case: Automated testing, batch processing, custom interface development

**Alternative Flow 2: Solution Architect Customer Demo**
- Solution architect receives customer documents for proof-of-concept
- Architect processes customer documents offline (data sensitivity)
- Architect deploys demo with customer-specific database
- Architect demonstrates with customer-relevant queries during sales meeting
- Customer sees their own content being queried intelligently
- Leads to proof-of-concept approval

**Alternative Flow 3: Configuration Customization**
- User reviews default configuration before deployment
- User adjusts similarity threshold from 0.7 to 0.8 (higher precision)
- User adjusts retrieval count from 5 to 10 results
- User redeploys with customized configuration
- User evaluates impact on result quality
