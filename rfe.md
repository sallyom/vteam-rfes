# BugFix Workspace Type

**Feature Overview:**

The BugFix Workspace Type streamlines bug identification, resolution planning, and implementation by providing developers with an integrated workspace that automatically syncs bug tracking between GitHub Issues and Jira, while maintaining implementation documentation in a centralized Spec Repository. Developers can start from a bug description or GitHub Issue URL, and the workspace will guide them through bug analysis, resolution planning, and implementation—using GitHub Issue as the primary tracking artifact and generating bugfix.md documentation for release engineering. This eliminates the context-switching between tools and manual tracking overhead that currently burdens developers, while ensuring PMs and release engineers have the visibility they need.

**Goals:**

* **Primary Users**: Developers who need to identify, plan, and fix bugs efficiently
* **User Benefits**:
  * Eliminate context switching between GitHub Issues, Jira, and development environments
  * Reduce manual tracking overhead—work once, sync everywhere
  * Guide developers through structured bug analysis and resolution workflow
  * Ensure PMs have real-time visibility into bug status without requiring developers to manually update multiple systems
  * Enable release engineers to access standardized bug and fix documentation for changelog generation
* **Current State vs. Future State**:
  * **Today**: Bugs are tracked inconsistently across GitHub Issues (developer preference) and Jira (PM preference). Developers often fail to keep tracking systems updated, leading to visibility gaps. Bug analysis and fixes lack standardized implementation documentation for release engineering.
  * **With This Feature**: A single workspace where developers work from GitHub Issues (automatically created if needed), with automatic Jira synchronization (future). GitHub Issue serves as the bug tracking artifact. Structured sessions guide bug analysis and implementation, producing standardized bugfix.md documentation in the Spec Repository for release engineering and audit purposes.

**Out of Scope:**

* Feature requests and enhancements (strictly bugs only)
* Full Jira integration (deferred to later iteration)
* Automatic PR validation and merging
* Automatic test execution and validation within workspace
* Release notes generation (foundation provided, full implementation deferred)
* Bugzilla integration (future consideration)

**Requirements:**

* **MVP Requirements** (must-have for initial release):
  * Three session types within BugFix Workspace: Bug-review, Bug-resolution-plan, and Bug-implement-fix
  * Generic session type available (similar to RFE Workspace)
  * Support bug initiation from two sources: text description or GitHub Issue URL
  * Automatically create GitHub Issue if starting from text description
  * Use GitHub Issue as primary bug tracking artifact (with standard format/template)
  * Generate bugfix.md in Spec Repository containing: link to GitHub Issue, implementation plan, steps taken, and link to PR
  * Use naming convention for bugfix.md: `bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md`
  * Implement proposed fix in supporting repository feature branch (e.g., `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>`)
  * Update GitHub Issue throughout the workflow with analysis findings, resolution plan, and implementation progress
  * Push bugfix.md to Spec Repository
  * Leverage Claude runner with agents (system determines agents, users can emphasize specific agents)
  * Reuse existing workspace infrastructure from RFE Workspace where applicable
  * Include tests and documentation in implementation

* **Post-MVP Requirements** (can be delivered later):
  * Full bidirectional GitHub Issue ↔ Jira synchronization
  * Support for starting workflow from Jira ticket reference
  * Automatic PR creation and validation
  * Automated test execution and validation
  * Release notes generation from bugfix artifacts
  * Bugzilla integration

**Done - Acceptance Criteria:**

From a developer's perspective, the BugFix Workspace is complete when:

1. A developer can create a BugFix Workspace by providing either a bug description or GitHub Issue URL
2. If starting from a description, the workspace automatically creates a GitHub Issue with standardized format
3. The workspace provides Bug-review session that analyzes the bug and updates GitHub Issue with technical analysis and root cause findings
4. The workspace provides Bug-resolution-plan session that generates bugfix.md with implementation strategy and updates GitHub Issue with the plan
5. The workspace provides Bug-implement-fix session that implements the proposed fix in a feature branch of the supporting repository
6. The workspace provides a generic session type for ad-hoc work
7. bugfix.md is pushed to the Spec Repository with naming convention `bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` and includes links to GitHub Issue and PR
8. GitHub Issue is updated throughout the workflow to reflect current status (analysis, plan, implementation progress)
9. The implementation includes tests and documentation
10. A feature branch (e.g., `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>`) with the proposed fix is created and ready for human validation
11. The developer can return to the workspace to iterate and refine based on testing feedback

**Use Cases - i.e. User Experience & Workflow:**

**Main Success Scenario: Bug Fix from GitHub Issue**

1. Developer receives notification of bug via GitHub Issue #1234
2. Developer creates new BugFix Workspace, providing GitHub Issue URL: `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/1234`
3. Workspace validates GitHub Issue exists and loads its details
4. Developer initiates **Bug-review session**:
   - Claude runner with agents analyzes the bug from GitHub Issue
   - Agents research codebase to understand root cause
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment containing technical analysis, affected components, and root cause findings
5. Developer initiates **Bug-resolution-plan session**:
   - Agents propose resolution strategies based on analysis
   - Developer reviews and refines approach
   - `bugfix-gh-1234.md` is created in Spec Repository with implementation plan
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment containing resolution approach and plan
6. Developer initiates **Bug-implement-fix session**:
   - Agents implement fix in supporting repository feature branch `bugfix/gh-1234`
   - Tests are written/updated
   - Documentation is updated
   - `bugfix-gh-1234.md` is updated with detailed implementation steps
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment linking to feature branch and implementation summary
7. Developer exits workspace, validates fix in feature branch manually
8. Developer returns to workspace for refinement if needed (repeat steps 4-6)
9. When satisfied, developer manually creates PR from feature branch
10. Developer adds PR link to GitHub Issue and updates `bugfix-gh-1234.md` with PR reference
11. bugfix-gh-1234.md remains in Spec Repository for release engineering use

**Alternative Flow: Bug from Description**

1. Developer encounters bug during development
2. Developer creates BugFix Workspace, providing text description of bug including: symptoms, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior
3. Workspace automatically creates GitHub Issue with standardized template populated from description
4. Workspace notifies developer: "Created GitHub Issue #5678: [title]"
5. Workspace creates `bugfix-gh-5678.md` placeholder in Spec Repository
6. Workflow continues as main success scenario steps 4-11

**Alternative Flow: Generic Session**

1. Developer in existing BugFix Workspace needs to perform ad-hoc investigation
2. Developer initiates generic session
3. Works with Claude runner and agents for open-ended exploration
4. Returns to structured sessions when ready

**Questions to answer:**

* **Architecture & Design**:
  1. What is the exact schema/format for bugfix.md? Should it include sections like: Summary, Root Cause Analysis, Resolution Approach, Implementation Steps, Testing Notes, PR Link, Related Issues?
  2. Which .specify templates or /slash commands from RFE Workspace should be reused vs. created specifically for BugFix Workspace?
  3. What workspace infrastructure components from RFE Workspace need to be refactored into generic/reusable components for multiple workspace types?
  4. What is the standardized GitHub Issue template format? Required fields: Title, Description, Reproduction Steps, Expected Behavior, Actual Behavior, Environment, Severity/Priority?
  5. How should the workspace handle scenarios where a GitHub Issue already exists but has insufficient information for bug analysis?
  6. Should the workspace support linking multiple GitHub Issues to a single bugfix (e.g., duplicates discovered during investigation)?
  7. How should bugfix.md handle multiple iterations/refinements? Append to single file or version with timestamps?

* **Workflow & UX**:
  8. When a developer returns to iterate, should the workspace automatically detect the existing feature branch and continue from there, or create a new branch?
  9. How should the workspace guide developers who are unsure which session type to start with?
  10. What happens if a developer skips Bug-review or Bug-resolution-plan and goes straight to Bug-implement-fix?
  11. Should there be guard rails to prevent implementing fixes before completing analysis and planning?

* **Integration & Synchronization**:
  12. What GitHub Issue fields should be read/written by the workspace? (Title, description, labels, assignees, comments, milestones, projects?)
  13. What is the strategy for updating GitHub Issues? (Comments for each session stage? Update issue body? Add labels?)
  14. Should workspace updates to GitHub Issues be clearly identified (e.g., comment footer, specific label, bot account)?
  15. What permissions are required for GitHub Issue creation/updates and Spec Repository operations?
  16. How should the workspace handle rate limiting from GitHub API?
  17. Should the workspace validate GitHub Issue format before proceeding, or attempt to auto-fix/enhance insufficient issues?

* **Testing & Validation**:
  18. What constitutes adequate test coverage for a bug fix? Should the workspace enforce minimum standards (e.g., regression test required)?
  19. Should the workspace provide any automated validation before marking implementation complete?
  20. How should the workspace handle bugs that cannot be reproduced?
  21. Should the workspace run existing tests to validate the fix doesn't introduce regressions?

* **Future GitHub Issue ↔ Jira Integration**:
  22. What Jira ticket type should GitHub Issue bugs map to? (Bug, Task, Story?)
  23. What Jira workflow states align with workspace session states and GitHub Issue states?
  24. Should bidirectional sync be real-time, webhook-triggered, or batch/scheduled?
  25. How should the workspace handle Jira-specific fields that don't exist in GitHub Issues (e.g., Story Points, Sprint)?
  26. When starting from a Jira reference (post-MVP), should the workspace create a GitHub Issue first, or work directly from Jira until implementation?

**Background & Strategic Fit:**

This feature addresses a critical pain point in the development workflow: the fragmentation of bug tracking across tools that serve different stakeholders. Developers naturally gravitate toward GitHub Issues because it's integrated with their codebase and development workflow. Product Managers and project stakeholders prefer Jira for its project management capabilities and cross-team visibility. This divide creates friction: developers often neglect to update tracking systems because it requires context-switching and duplicate data entry, while PMs lack visibility into bug status and struggle to coordinate releases.

The BugFix Workspace Type strategically positions the platform as the workflow orchestrator that bridges these tools. By using GitHub Issue as the primary bug tracking artifact and automatically synchronizing with Jira (future), we eliminate redundant artifact management while ensuring all stakeholders have visibility. Developers work naturally with GitHub Issues throughout the workflow, while the workspace generates bugfix.md documentation in the Spec Repository to support release engineering and provide an auditable record of implementation decisions.

This design decision—using GitHub Issue as primary artifact rather than creating intermediate bug.md files—is deliberate and strategic:
1. **Reduces overhead**: Eliminates three-way synchronization complexity (bug.md ↔ GitHub Issue ↔ Jira)
2. **Leverages existing tools**: GitHub Issues already provide discussion threads, version history, notifications, and integrations
3. **Separates concerns**: GitHub Issue = tracking and discussion, bugfix.md = technical implementation record for release engineering
4. **Simplifies future Jira sync**: Direct GitHub Issue ↔ Jira synchronization is well-understood with existing tools/patterns

Furthermore, this feature establishes patterns for future workspace types. By creating reusable infrastructure and demonstrating how workspaces can orchestrate multi-tool workflows with Claude runner and agents, we build a foundation for additional specialized workspace types (e.g., Security Fix Workspace, Performance Optimization Workspace, etc.).

The decision to defer full Jira integration to post-MVP is strategic: it allows us to validate the core workflow with GitHub Issues first, which is less complex and closer to the developer workflow. Once we've proven the value and refined the UX, we can layer in GitHub Issue ↔ Jira synchronization with confidence, leveraging existing integration patterns and tools.

**Customer Considerations**

* **Development Teams**:
  * Developers are time-sensitive and resistance to process overhead is high. The workspace must feel like it's accelerating their work, not adding bureaucracy.
  * Clear visual feedback on synchronization status is critical to build trust that updates are propagating correctly.
  * The ability to work offline or with limited connectivity may be important for some teams (consider how syncing handles this).

* **Product Management Teams**:
  * PMs need confidence that GitHub Issue updates accurately reflect bug progress.
  * Visibility into bug status should not require learning new tools—GitHub Issues and (future) Jira provide familiar interfaces.
  * Standardized bugfix.md format in Spec Repository enables PMs to build dashboards and reports for tracking implementation status.

* **Release Engineering Teams**:
  * Consistency in bugfix.md format is critical for automation and tooling.
  * Clear versioning and history of bugfix.md in Spec Repository enables release notes generation and post-release analysis.
  * Direct linking from bugfix.md to GitHub Issues and PRs provides traceability for release documentation.

* **Enterprise Customers**:
  * GitHub Enterprise and Jira Data Center compatibility must be considered (not just cloud versions).
  * Audit trails and compliance logging may be required for bug fixes in regulated industries.
  * SSO and permission models must align with existing organizational policies.

* **Open Source Projects**:
  * Many open source projects use GitHub Issues exclusively without Jira.
  * The workspace should gracefully handle absence of Jira integration without degraded experience.

* **Security & Privacy**:
  * Bug details may contain sensitive information (security vulnerabilities, customer data, etc.).
  * Access controls for Spec Repository and synchronization mechanisms must respect existing security policies.
  * Consider whether certain bugs should be marked as "private" and excluded from certain sync targets.
