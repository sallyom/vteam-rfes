# BugFix Workspace Type

**Feature Overview:**

The BugFix Workspace Type streamlines bug identification, resolution planning, and implementation by providing developers with an integrated workspace that syncs bug tracking between GitHub Issues and Jira via a manual sync button, while maintaining implementation documentation in a centralized Spec Repository. Developers can start from a bug description or GitHub Issue URL, and the workspace will guide them through bug analysis, resolution planning, and implementation—using GitHub Issue as the primary tracking artifact and generating bugfix.md documentation in organized folders within their Spec Repository. This eliminates the context-switching between tools and manual tracking overhead that currently burdens developers, while ensuring PMs and release engineers have the visibility they need. The Spec Repository also serves as a personal portfolio of every bug the developer has worked on.

**Goals:**

* **Primary Users**: Developers who need to identify, plan, and fix bugs efficiently
* **User Benefits**:
  * Eliminate context switching between GitHub Issues, Jira, and development environments
  * Reduce manual tracking overhead—one-click Jira sync from workspace sessions
  * Guide developers through structured bug analysis and resolution workflow
  * Ensure PMs have visibility into bug status via synced Jira Tasks with links back to GitHub Issues
  * Enable release engineers to access standardized bug and fix documentation for changelog generation
  * Provide developers with organized portfolio of all bugs worked on in their Spec Repository
* **Current State vs. Future State**:
  * **Today**: Bugs are tracked inconsistently across GitHub Issues (developer preference) and Jira (PM preference). Developers often fail to keep tracking systems updated, leading to visibility gaps. Bug analysis and fixes lack standardized implementation documentation for release engineering.
  * **With This Feature**: A single workspace where developers work from GitHub Issues (automatically created if needed), with one-click Jira sync button to create/update Jira Tasks. GitHub Issue serves as the bug tracking artifact. Structured sessions guide bug analysis and implementation, producing standardized bugfix.md documentation organized in bug-specific folders within the Spec Repository, creating a personal portfolio of bug fixes alongside release engineering artifacts.

**Out of Scope:**

* Feature requests and enhancements (strictly bugs only)
* Bidirectional automatic Jira synchronization (manual sync button is in scope)
* Automatic PR validation and merging
* Automatic test execution and validation within workspace
* Release notes generation (foundation provided, full implementation deferred)
* Bugzilla integration (future consideration)
* Starting workflow from Jira ticket reference (deferred to post-MVP)

**Requirements:**

* **MVP Requirements** (must-have for initial release):
  * Three session types within BugFix Workspace: Bug-review, Bug-resolution-plan, and Bug-implement-fix
  * Generic session type available (similar to RFE Workspace)
  * Support bug initiation from two sources: text description or GitHub Issue URL
  * Automatically create GitHub Issue if starting from text description
  * Use GitHub Issue as primary bug tracking artifact (with standard format/template)
  * **Jira Sync Button** (similar to RFE Workspace):
    * Available in Bug-review session: Syncs GitHub Issue key fields (title, description, status) to Jira Task, creates bidirectional links (Jira Task links to GitHub Issue, GitHub Issue links to Jira Task)
    * Available in Bug-implement-fix session: Uploads bugfix.md content as a comment to the existing Jira Task
    * Subsequent syncs update existing Jira Task rather than creating duplicates
  * **Spec Repository Folder Structure**:
    * Create folder for each bug: `bug-<github-issue-number>/`
    * Generate bugfix.md within folder: `bug-<github-issue-number>/bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md`
    * bugfix.md includes at top: GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL (after sync), implementation plan, steps taken, PR link
    * Folder can contain additional artifacts (test results, screenshots, etc.)
  * Implement proposed fix in supporting repository feature branch (e.g., `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>`)
  * Update GitHub Issue throughout the workflow with analysis findings, resolution plan, and implementation progress
  * Leverage Claude runner with agents (system determines agents, users can emphasize specific agents)
  * Reuse existing workspace infrastructure from RFE Workspace where applicable
  * Include tests and documentation in implementation

* **Post-MVP Requirements** (can be delivered later):
  * Automatic bidirectional GitHub Issue ↔ Jira synchronization (without manual button click)
  * Support for starting workflow from Jira ticket reference
  * Automatic PR creation and validation
  * Automated test execution and validation
  * Release notes generation from bugfix artifacts
  * Bugzilla integration
  * Rich artifact management within bug folders (screenshots, logs, test reports)

**Done - Acceptance Criteria:**

From a developer's perspective, the BugFix Workspace is complete when:

1. A developer can create a BugFix Workspace by providing either a bug description or GitHub Issue URL
2. If starting from a description, the workspace automatically creates a GitHub Issue with standardized format
3. The workspace provides Bug-review session that analyzes the bug and updates GitHub Issue with technical analysis and root cause findings
4. Bug-review session includes a "Sync to Jira" button that creates a Jira Task with GitHub Issue key fields and establishes bidirectional links
5. The workspace provides Bug-resolution-plan session that generates bugfix.md with implementation strategy and updates GitHub Issue with the plan
6. The workspace provides Bug-implement-fix session that implements the proposed fix in a feature branch of the supporting repository
7. Bug-implement-fix session includes a "Sync to Jira" button that posts bugfix.md content as a comment to the Jira Task
8. The workspace provides a generic session type for ad-hoc work
9. A folder `bug-<issue-number>/` is created in the Spec Repository
10. bugfix.md is created within the folder at `bug-<issue-number>/bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` with GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL (if synced), implementation plan, steps taken, and PR link at the top
11. GitHub Issue is updated throughout the workflow to reflect current status (analysis, plan, implementation progress) and links to Jira Task (if synced)
12. The implementation includes tests and documentation
13. A feature branch (e.g., `bugfix/gh-<issue-number>`) with the proposed fix is created and ready for human validation
14. The developer can return to the workspace to iterate and refine based on testing feedback
15. Subsequent Jira syncs update the existing Jira Task rather than creating new ones

**Use Cases - i.e. User Experience & Workflow:**

**Main Success Scenario: Bug Fix from GitHub Issue with Jira Sync**

1. Developer receives notification of bug via GitHub Issue #1234
2. Developer creates new BugFix Workspace, providing GitHub Issue URL: `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/1234`
3. Workspace validates GitHub Issue exists and loads its details
4. Workspace creates folder in Spec Repository: `bug-1234/`
5. Developer initiates **Bug-review session**:
   - Claude runner with agents analyzes the bug from GitHub Issue
   - Agents research codebase to understand root cause
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment containing technical analysis, affected components, and root cause findings
   - Developer clicks **"Sync to Jira"** button
   - Workspace creates Jira Task with GitHub Issue title, description, and status
   - Jira Task includes link to GitHub Issue #1234
   - GitHub Issue is updated with link to Jira Task (e.g., PROJ-5678)
6. Developer initiates **Bug-resolution-plan session**:
   - Agents propose resolution strategies based on analysis
   - Developer reviews and refines approach
   - `bug-1234/bugfix-gh-1234.md` is created in Spec Repository with:
     - GitHub Issue URL: `https://github.com/org/repo/issues/1234`
     - Jira Task URL: `https://company.atlassian.net/browse/PROJ-5678`
     - Implementation plan
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment containing resolution approach and plan
7. Developer initiates **Bug-implement-fix session**:
   - Agents implement fix in supporting repository feature branch `bugfix/gh-1234`
   - Tests are written/updated
   - Documentation is updated
   - `bug-1234/bugfix-gh-1234.md` is updated with detailed implementation steps
   - GitHub Issue is updated with comment linking to feature branch and implementation summary
   - Developer clicks **"Sync to Jira"** button
   - Workspace posts bugfix.md content as a comment to Jira Task PROJ-5678
8. Developer exits workspace, validates fix in feature branch manually
9. Developer returns to workspace for refinement if needed (repeat steps 5-7)
10. When satisfied, developer manually creates PR from feature branch
11. Developer adds PR link to GitHub Issue and updates `bug-1234/bugfix-gh-1234.md` with PR reference
12. `bug-1234/` folder in Spec Repository serves as complete record of bug fix, accessible for release engineering and developer portfolio

**Alternative Flow: Bug from Description**

1. Developer encounters bug during development
2. Developer creates BugFix Workspace, providing text description of bug including: symptoms, reproduction steps, expected vs actual behavior
3. Workspace automatically creates GitHub Issue with standardized template populated from description
4. Workspace notifies developer: "Created GitHub Issue #5678: [title]"
5. Workspace creates folder in Spec Repository: `bug-5678/`
6. Workflow continues as main success scenario steps 5-12 (using bug-5678 instead of bug-1234)

**Alternative Flow: Skip Jira Sync**

1. Developer follows main success scenario steps 1-7
2. Developer chooses not to click "Sync to Jira" buttons (optional)
3. Workflow completes successfully with GitHub Issue as sole tracking artifact
4. `bug-<issue-number>/bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md` is created without Jira Task URL
5. This flow supports teams/projects not using Jira

**Alternative Flow: Generic Session**

1. Developer in existing BugFix Workspace needs to perform ad-hoc investigation
2. Developer initiates generic session
3. Works with Claude runner and agents for open-ended exploration
4. Returns to structured sessions when ready

**Questions to answer:**

* **Architecture & Design**:
  1. What is the exact schema/format for bugfix.md? Proposed sections:
     - **Header**: GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL (if synced), Created Date, Last Updated
     - **Summary**: One-paragraph bug description
     - **Root Cause Analysis**: Technical analysis from Bug-review session
     - **Resolution Approach**: Strategy from Bug-resolution-plan session
     - **Implementation Steps**: Detailed steps from Bug-implement-fix session
     - **Testing Notes**: Test cases added/modified, validation results
     - **PR Link**: Link to pull request
     - **Related Issues**: Links to duplicate or related bugs
  2. Which .specify templates or /slash commands from RFE Workspace should be reused vs. created specifically for BugFix Workspace?
  3. What workspace infrastructure components from RFE Workspace need to be refactored into generic/reusable components for multiple workspace types (especially Jira sync button)?
  4. What is the standardized GitHub Issue template format? Required fields: Title, Description, Reproduction Steps, Expected Behavior, Actual Behavior, Environment, Severity/Priority?
  5. How should the workspace handle scenarios where a GitHub Issue already exists but has insufficient information for bug analysis?
  6. Should the workspace support linking multiple GitHub Issues to a single bugfix (e.g., duplicates discovered during investigation)?
  7. How should bugfix.md handle multiple iterations/refinements? Append to single file or version with timestamps?
  8. Should `bug-<issue-number>/` folders support additional artifacts (screenshots, logs, test reports) beyond bugfix.md?

* **Workflow & UX**:
  9. When a developer returns to iterate, should the workspace automatically detect the existing feature branch and continue from there, or create a new branch?
  10. How should the workspace guide developers who are unsure which session type to start with?
  11. What happens if a developer skips Bug-review or Bug-resolution-plan and goes straight to Bug-implement-fix?
  12. Should there be guard rails to prevent implementing fixes before completing analysis and planning?
  13. What UX should the "Sync to Jira" button provide? (Progress indicator, success message with Jira Task URL, error handling?)
  14. If developer clicks "Sync to Jira" in Bug-implement-fix but hasn't synced in Bug-review yet, should workspace prompt to sync Bug-review first, or handle both syncs?
  15. How should workspace indicate whether a bug has been synced to Jira? (Visual indicator in session UI, metadata in bugfix.md?)

* **Integration & Synchronization**:
  16. What GitHub Issue fields should be read/written by the workspace? (Title, description, labels, assignees, comments, milestones, projects?)
  17. What is the strategy for updating GitHub Issues? (Comments for each session stage? Update issue body? Add labels?)
  18. Should workspace updates to GitHub Issues be clearly identified (e.g., comment footer, specific label, bot account)?
  19. What permissions are required for GitHub Issue creation/updates and Spec Repository operations?
  20. How should the workspace handle rate limiting from GitHub API?
  21. Should the workspace validate GitHub Issue format before proceeding, or attempt to auto-fix/enhance insufficient issues?
  22. **Jira API Integration**:
     - What Jira API endpoints are needed? (Create Task, Update Task, Add Comment, Create Link?)
     - What authentication method for Jira? (API token, OAuth, Personal Access Token?)
     - What Jira fields are required to create a Task? (Project key, Summary, Description, Issue Type?)
     - How to create bidirectional links? (GitHub Issue link in Jira Task description? Custom Jira field? Web links?)
     - How to store Jira Task ID for subsequent updates? (In bugfix.md? In workspace metadata? In GitHub Issue as comment/label?)
     - What error handling for Jira API failures? (Graceful degradation? Retry logic? User notification?)
     - How to handle Jira permission errors? (Some users may not have create Task permission in certain projects)

* **Testing & Validation**:
  23. What constitutes adequate test coverage for a bug fix? Should the workspace enforce minimum standards (e.g., regression test required)?
  24. Should the workspace provide any automated validation before marking implementation complete?
  25. How should the workspace handle bugs that cannot be reproduced?
  26. Should the workspace run existing tests to validate the fix doesn't introduce regressions?

* **Future Enhancements (Post-MVP)**:
  27. Should Jira Task status be automatically updated based on GitHub Issue status or PR merge? (Automatic bidirectional sync)
  28. What Jira workflow states should align with workspace session completion? (e.g., "In Progress" after Bug-review, "Done" after PR merge?)
  29. How should the workspace handle Jira-specific fields that don't exist in GitHub Issues (e.g., Story Points, Sprint, Epic Link)?
  30. When starting from a Jira reference (post-MVP), should the workspace create a GitHub Issue first, or work directly from Jira until implementation?
  31. Should workspace support bulk sync operations for multiple bugs?
  32. Should `bug-<issue-number>/` folders be searchable/indexable for developer portfolio queries? (e.g., "Show me all P1 bugs I fixed in Q4")

**Background & Strategic Fit:**

This feature addresses a critical pain point in the development workflow: the fragmentation of bug tracking across tools that serve different stakeholders. Developers naturally gravitate toward GitHub Issues because it's integrated with their codebase and development workflow. Product Managers and project stakeholders prefer Jira for its project management capabilities and cross-team visibility. This divide creates friction: developers often neglect to update tracking systems because it requires context-switching and duplicate data entry, while PMs lack visibility into bug status and struggle to coordinate releases.

The BugFix Workspace Type strategically positions the platform as the workflow orchestrator that bridges these tools. By using GitHub Issue as the primary bug tracking artifact and providing a manual Jira sync button (similar to RFE Workspace), we give developers control over when and how PM visibility occurs. Developers work naturally with GitHub Issues throughout the workflow, while the workspace generates bugfix.md documentation organized in `bug-<issue-number>/` folders within the Spec Repository, creating both a release engineering resource and a personal developer portfolio.

**Key Design Decisions:**

1. **GitHub Issue as primary artifact** (not intermediate bug.md):
   - **Reduces overhead**: Eliminates three-way synchronization complexity
   - **Leverages existing tools**: GitHub Issues already provide discussion threads, version history, notifications, and integrations
   - **Separates concerns**: GitHub Issue = tracking and discussion, bugfix.md = technical implementation record for release engineering

2. **Manual Jira sync button** (not automatic bidirectional sync):
   - **Developer control**: Developers choose when to sync, reducing automation surprises
   - **Simpler MVP**: Manual sync is easier to implement and debug than bidirectional webhooks
   - **Pattern reuse**: Leverages existing RFE Workspace Jira sync button implementation
   - **Graceful degradation**: Works perfectly for teams not using Jira

3. **Folder structure in Spec Repository** (`bug-<issue-number>/bugfix-gh-<issue-number>.md`):
   - **Organization**: Each bug gets its own folder for current and future artifacts
   - **Developer portfolio**: Spec Repository becomes searchable record of all bugs a developer has worked on
   - **Scalability**: Supports additional artifacts (screenshots, logs, test reports) without namespace conflicts
   - **Release engineering**: Easy to locate bug artifacts by GitHub Issue number

Furthermore, this feature establishes patterns for future workspace types. By creating reusable infrastructure (especially the Jira sync button pattern) and demonstrating how workspaces can orchestrate multi-tool workflows with Claude runner and agents, we build a foundation for additional specialized workspace types (e.g., Security Fix Workspace, Performance Optimization Workspace, etc.).

The phased approach—manual Jira sync in MVP, automatic bidirectional sync post-MVP—is strategic: it validates the core workflow and developer UX first, then layers in automation once we understand usage patterns and edge cases. This reduces risk and allows us to learn from real-world usage before committing to complex bidirectional synchronization logic.

**Customer Considerations**

* **Development Teams**:
  * Developers are time-sensitive and resistance to process overhead is high. The workspace must feel like it's accelerating their work, not adding bureaucracy.
  * Clear visual feedback on Jira sync button (progress, success with Jira Task URL, error messages) is critical to build trust.
  * The ability to work offline or with limited connectivity may be important—manual sync button allows developers to work fully offline and sync when ready.
  * The `bug-<issue-number>/` folder structure in their Spec Repository serves as a personal portfolio of bugs fixed, useful for performance reviews and knowledge transfer.

* **Product Management Teams**:
  * PMs need confidence that GitHub Issue updates accurately reflect bug progress.
  * Manual Jira sync provides visibility when developers choose to sync, balancing developer autonomy with PM needs.
  * Jira Tasks created via sync button include links back to GitHub Issues for full context.
  * Standardized bugfix.md format in Spec Repository (`bug-<issue-number>/` folders) enables PMs to build dashboards and reports for tracking implementation status.

* **Release Engineering Teams**:
  * Consistency in bugfix.md format is critical for automation and tooling.
  * Folder-based organization (`bug-<issue-number>/`) makes it easy to locate bug artifacts programmatically.
  * Clear versioning and history of bugfix.md in Spec Repository enables release notes generation and post-release analysis.
  * Direct linking from bugfix.md header (GitHub Issue URL, Jira Task URL, PR link) provides complete traceability for release documentation.

* **Enterprise Customers**:
  * GitHub Enterprise and Jira Data Center compatibility must be considered (not just cloud versions).
  * Jira API authentication must support enterprise requirements (API tokens, OAuth, SSO integration).
  * Audit trails and compliance logging may be required for bug fixes in regulated industries—Spec Repository provides git-based audit trail.
  * SSO and permission models must align with existing organizational policies.
  * Manual Jira sync provides control over what information leaves developer workspace and enters PM/stakeholder systems.

* **Open Source Projects**:
  * Many open source projects use GitHub Issues exclusively without Jira.
  * The workspace should gracefully handle absence of Jira integration without degraded experience—Jira sync button is optional.
  * Folder structure in Spec Repository (`bug-<issue-number>/`) still provides value for organizing contributions even without Jira.

* **Security & Privacy**:
  * Bug details may contain sensitive information (security vulnerabilities, customer data, etc.).
  * Access controls for Spec Repository and Jira synchronization must respect existing security policies.
  * Manual Jira sync button gives developers control over when sensitive information is synced—they can choose not to sync security-sensitive bugs.
  * Consider whether certain bugs should be marked as "private" and excluded from Jira sync or have restricted visibility.
  * Jira API credentials must be securely stored and managed (not hardcoded, use secure credential storage).
